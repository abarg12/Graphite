HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN COMPILER:
    To compile type "make" while in the directory. 

    To run the compiler (as stands), type "./toplevel.native" after compiling and begin programming!

HOW TO RUN TEST SCRIPT: 
    In order to run the testing script, enter 'chmod u+x runtests.sh' into your terminal, run the command, and then run './runtests.sh'. You should have opam properly installed to run this program. It will print messages documenting the testing progress, and will print a message if a test fails unexpectedly. 

SYNTAX WE STILL NEED TO ADD:
    We may look into syntactic sugar for dictionaries, such as:
        dict_name[key_name] = some_value;
